====================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

DotaKeys is a set of AutoIt script for remapping keys, creating key macros and 
mouse clicking automation for Dota and Dota 2.

2. INSTALLATION

3. CONFIGURATION
----------------

3.1 KEY MAPPING
---------------

The keys for mapping are specified in `run` directory scripts. You can open any script 
with the hero name in editor and fix key mapping.

This is example of key mapping for Admiral hero:
	global const $kKeys = "s,h|q,e|w,d|e,x|r,t"

This line means that these keys will be mapped (`->` symbol means `to`):
	s -> h
	q -> e
	w -> d
	e -> x
	r -> t

You can specify macros to map one key to several. This is an example:
	global const $kKeys = "x,q,w,e|s,h"

This means that pressing of the `x` key will lead to pressing `q`, `w` and `e` keys.

3.2 AUTOCLICK
-------------

The autoclick function is emulation left button mouse clicking to the current pointer
position after any key pressing.

You can enable or disable autoclick mechanism by changing this variable in the 
`config\global.au3` file:
	global const $kIsAutoClick = false

The `false` variable matches to disable autoclick and `true` otherwise.

3.3 SYSTEM KEYS
---------------

The `ENTER` key pressing will lead to pause DotaKeys script. You can reassign pause key in 
the `config\global.au3` file:
	global const $kPauseKey = Chr(13)

This is example for assigning `PAUSE` key instead the `ENTER` one:
	global const $kPauseKey = "{PAUSE}"

4. LAUNCHING
------------

NB: DotaKeys scripts are not executable `exe` files! All of these are placed to the `run` directory.

There are steps to run DotaKeys script:
1. Run script with your hero name from the `run` directory.
2. Switch to the Warcraft 3/Dota 2 client window.
3. Press Alt+F2 to start script.
4. You can stop script by Alt+F1 pressing.
