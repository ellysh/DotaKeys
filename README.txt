L2Bot is toolkit of AutoIt scripts to implement Lineage 2 bot.

2. INSTALLATION

3. CONFIGURATION
----------------

NB: You must set the `chat with Enter` checkbox in your Lineage client application for the correct bot's working.

Configuration of the L2Bot consist of the three stages:
1. Configuration of the bot according to your Lineage client's interface.
2. Configuration of the mob's names to attack them by bot.
3. Configuration of the hotbar keys according your character's class.

All these stages will be described below.

3.1 INTERFACE CONFIGURATION
---------------------------

You can use the `configurator_en.au3` script from the `run` directory to configure farm bot according your Lineage client's interface. All interface's parameters will be saved in `interface.au3` file from the `conf` directory.

There are steps to perform the interface configuration:
1. Run your Lineage client in the window mode. You can press Alt+Enter for switching to the window mode.
2. Resize the Lineage client window to full screen with mouse.
3. Get into the game with your character.
4. Run `configurator_en.au3` script from the `run` directory.
5. Switch to the Lineage client window.
6. Press Alt+F2 to start configuration script.
7. Select the point in the Lineage window according the information in popup tip. You can select point at the current cursor's position by pressing Alt+F3.
8. The popup tips will be disappeared after you has selected the last point. Configuration is complete.

This is illustration of all configuration points in the `interface_conf.jpg` file from the `images` directory.

You can use the `configurator_fishing_en.au3` script from the `run` directory to configure fishing bot. This script works like the described above `configurator_en.au3` one. This is illustration of all configuration points for fishing bot in the `fishing_conf.jpg` file from the `images` directory.

3.2 MOB'S NAMES CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------

There are steps to perform the mob's names configuration:
1. Open the `targets.au3` fle from the `conf` directory with any text editor.
2. Write mob's names into `$kTargetNames` list.
3. Change value of the `$kTargetCount` variable according count of elements in the `$kTargetNames` list.

NB: You can specify one or two letters of the mob's names for the Gracia Final and above Lineage chronicles. This is example:
	global const $kTargetCount = 2
	global const $kTargetNames[$kTargetCount] = [ "G", "Wo" ]

You must specify full mob's names for Lineage chronicles below the Gracia Final one:
	global const $kTargetCount = 2
	global const $kTargetNames[$kTargetCount] = [ "Gremlin", "Wolf" ]

3.3 HOTBAR KEYS CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------

The L2Bot scripts implement the farm bots for several character's classes. All these scripts are placed to the `run` directory. Script's name is the same as relevant class's name.

The hotbar configuration is depended on the running script. You can use hotbar illustrations from the `images` directory. Name of the illustration file contains the character's class name and the `hotbar` word. For example, `bladedancer_hotbar.jpg` file is the illustration for `bladedancer.au3` script.

The `fishing_hotbar.jpg` file from the `images` directory is a hotbar illustration for the fishing bot.

4. LAUNCHING
